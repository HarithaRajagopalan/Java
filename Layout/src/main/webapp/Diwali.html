   <h1>DIWALI</h1>

 <p>Deepavali (also known as Diwali in many other countries) is a widely celebrated festival in Indian communities around the world, such as the Hindus, Jains, Sikhs, and the Nepalese Newar Buddhists. It is a joyous festival of lights, where families unite on the darkest night of the year to light candles, set off fireworks, and give gifts. They celebrate the victory of good over evil, as they mark different historical events and stories.
Although the main practice relates to Rama (an incarnation of Lord Vishnu) and Sita (an incarnation of his consort Lakshmi), in South India it is sometimes associated with the divine pair of Shiva-Shakti. According to the Skanda Purana, the Goddess Shakti observed austerity for 21 days, starting from the eighth day of the waxing period of the moon (the ashtami of shukla paksha) to get half of the body of Lord Shiva. This vow of austerity is known as kedhara vrata.

<p>Deepavali marks the final day of this austerity, also known as kedhara gauri vrata, to mark the day Lord Shiva accepted Shakti into the left half of his form and appeared as Ardhanarishvara. Ardent devotees observe this 21-day vrata by making a kalasha with 21 threads on it, and give 21 types of offerings for 35 days.
The Goddess Shakti is also known as Amma (meaning ‘mother’) in south India, especially in the states of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, which explains why some Indians in Malaysia relate Deepavali to the Goddess Shakti. Many villagers believe Shakti to be a protector, a punisher of evil people, a curer of diseases, and the one who gives welfare to the village.
